## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a deep-learning model that accurately predicts customer churn. By doing so, we aim to:
- Enable telecom companies to proactively manage churn and reduce revenue loss.
- Improve overall customer satisfaction by addressing potential churners with personalized incentives.
- Optimize marketing efforts and resource allocation for customer retention.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
We collected a comprehensive dataset comprising various customer attributes, call records, subscription details, and historical churn data.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing included cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to ensure data quality and consistency.

### Feature Engineering
We created relevant features such as customer tenure, usage patterns, and customer interactions to provide meaningful inputs to our deep learning model.

### Deep Learning Model
We designed and trained a deep neural network (DNN) using TensorFlow/Keras. The model architecture incorporates multiple layers with various activation functions to capture complex patterns within the data.

### Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure robustness.

## Results
Our deep learning model demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities, achieving a churn prediction accuracy rate of over 90%. It outperformed traditional machine learning methods and showcased its ability to identify potential churners well in advance.
